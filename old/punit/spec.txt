# A puny PHP testing framework

A test is just a function that returns a boolean. `true` means that the test passed, `false` failed. Put all your tests inside
a `/test` directory... and that's it.

A test is any function that fulfills one of the following requirements:
 - it's name starts with the word "test" and accepts no arguments
 - declares the @test annotation in it's doccomment and accepts no arguments

All tests must return some value that indicates if the test has passed or failed (see below).

Valid return types:
	boolean				true means success, false means failure
	string				a string is always interpreted as a failure message
	throws exception	test failed (obviously)
	anything else		test failed

The program should show, at least, how many tests were run, hoy many succeed and how many failed.

Usage:
	punit

Options:
	-h --help	Show this screen		@TODO
	--version	Show version number	@TODO
	-v				Verbose reporting		@TODO
